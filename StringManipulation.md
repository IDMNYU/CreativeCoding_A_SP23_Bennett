Sketch 4 Choice: String Manipulations - Data Visualizations or Algorithmic Poems

This should be heavily procedural, dynamic, or crunching data. This builds off of what you have learned thus far and takes it further. This is not to simply just have text appear. I am looking for you to take this further and to strengthen your coding chops.

###### Route 1:

1. Create something dynamic and interactive based on text! Some examples: typing game, responsive text, moving text, stylish/humorous movie/tv credits, etc

###### Route 2:

1. Using the <a href = "https://rednoise.org/rita/tutorial/index.php">Rita library</a> (available for both Processing and P5.js)

2. Create a data visualization based on a text, a MadLibs, or a bot

3. That "does something". I.e., There is an interactive experienced, something happens that is dynamic, or a time based animation of some sort.


###### Route 3:

1. Something heavily procedural, time based, having to do with text. 

2. See the Generative Design references for the direction that I am seeking.
