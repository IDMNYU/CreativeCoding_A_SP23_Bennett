### Sketch 3

### Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern Part II

####  Due March 1 18:00


Using a pattern created in sketch 2, how can you use it as a drawing tool/instrument? What if it that pattern was one bristle on a brush? A brush has multiple bristles on it. Think about each of those bristles touching the canvas with one stroke. What if three (or simply multiple) bristles touched the canvas at one time?

Using the pattern that you created in Sketch 2, use it in this sketch. You will build off of that code. 

How can you create multiple instances of that pattern, with each one VARYING slightly from the last? Now is the time to use your loops, if-statements, functions AND MATRIX TRANSFORMATIONS

The goal is to create multiple patterns, on ONE input. How can each pattern have a unique location on the screen, so that they are not all drawn on top of each other? You may NOT use random to place your shapes locations. You may not use the power of the draw loop to create multiples. Instead, use your event listeners.

Matrix transformations (see the reference), variables, loops and if-statements are your key ingredients.

Use your variables to parameterize and control this brush. Focus on one structure of code. By manipulaing your variables, you can control, diversify, and manipulate your design.

Can you send it values to animate it across the screen based upon an input? Can you create a loop, which creates your pattern? Can you then trigger that loop upon input? Can this sequence of events take in data, to make it slightly different over time? 

Can you then create different brushes, each with a unique form/pattern. How many iterations of your pattern occur with one click or mouse movement?

How does the size change? How does the space between the marks change? Can you make a spray can pattern? Does something happen to the mark once it's on the page? Does it bleed, spread, or blend with other colors on the page once it's there?

Try playing with probability!

 - How could you incorporate random and/or interactivity to add variety + change (but not location)? How could this be controlled over time? Hint: probability, millis, frameCount, if-statements.

 - Use your matrix transformations and for-loops on top of your pattern.

 - use event listeners!

 - do not have the power of multiples generated through the draw loop!

 - craft your code! Play with it!

- [Greg Drigo](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/977389) Make note: Greg's code execution is largely happening from the draw loop. Yet, he has SO much going on with the layers of code and the number of things that are happening each draw cycle, that I still share this one. Be wary of the draw loop! Multiples should happen on event/event listener, not powered by the draw loop!
- [Connor Hester](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/977329) Make note: Be The Computer and look at the code carefully, to see how it's structured and layered. There's many ways to achieve this assignment.

- [Sue Ying Jang](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1697860) Make note: Watch the use of the draw loop versus event listeners. Her code is quite layered.
